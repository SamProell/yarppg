Yet another rPPG
================

**yarppg** is yet another implementation of remote photoplethysmography in
Python.  Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) refers to the camera-based
measurement of a (blood volume) pulse signal.  It works by detecting small
changes in skin color, originating from the pulsation of blood [#]_.
